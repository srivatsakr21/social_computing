        "\n",
        "Usually, collaborative filtering is based on some sort of rating to determine the similarity between users. However, for games, the enjoyment and a rating do not always match. Additionally, only about 10% of players actually rate the games they play, which would make for a very incomplete dataset. Therefore, the playtime will be used instead of a rating system. This has the added benefit that playtime is usually the most authentic metric of enjoyment, as players are very unlikely to spend much time on a game they don't enjoy."

        "\n",
        "Before we start with the \"real\" recommender system, let us take a look at a more general form of recommending items using association rules.\n",
        "\n",
        "The concept of association rule mining is rather simple: Looking at an itemset, one tries to find dependencies between items that could \"belong together\". A common example would be buying food at the store: If, for example, meat and salt are bought together often, but meat without salt not that often, it is assumed that there is a connection between those two. For games, if it was found that most of the users who own the demo version of a game also own the full version of that game, it would be a reasonable assumption that these users liked the demo and therefore bought the full version.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Let us first cover the mathematical basis for association rules. The most important metrics used are **support**,  **confidence** and **lift**. The first is defined as the amount of times an item occurs in the itemset divided by the total number of items in the set; the second is defined as the support of a list of items [x,y,...] divided by the support of x. Lift is a measure describing the correlation between items. Written down mathematically:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$supp(x)= \\frac{len(x)}{len(n)}$$\n",
        "\n",
        "$$conf(x=>y) = \\frac{supp(x,y)}{supp(x)}$$\n",
        "\n",
        "$$lift(x=>y) = \\frac{P(x \\cap y)}{P(x) * P(y)}$$\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "It is important to note that support refers to an item or a list of items, while confidence refers to a rule. Also note that a lift of 1 means that x and y occur independently of each other, while a lift greater 1 means a positive correlation.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**1.** Your task here is to first convert the dictionary you created into a list of lists as this is the input required for the algorithm to work. Then, print out the most frequent items using the `min_support` attribute. Finally, print out the association rules and play around with the threshold value to get a reasonable amount of rules. \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**2.** Discuss your results and try to answer the following questions: What kind of recommendations can be made? What does a confidence of 1.0 mean and is it meaningful for recommending games? Can you spot a correlation between the games with the highest support and the rules with the highest confidence? How does this affect the lift?  \n",
        "**Hint:** Play around with the threshold values until you get a reasonable amount (4-30) rows as output."
